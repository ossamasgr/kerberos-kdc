Usage
Check your configuration
The default configuration is likely to be fine for your first steps, validate it using the config command.

./kdc config
You will receive a list of relevant configuration information. The defaults are derived from your hosts' configuration to allow for a quick test setup.

Example output: ./kdc config

System
  fqdn:      hostname.domain.name
KDC
  nat:       127.0.0.1
  port:      48088
Kerberos
  domain:    domain.name
  realm:     DOMAIN.NAME
  principal: tillt/hostname.domain.name@DOMAIN.NAME, password: matilda
Build the docker image
./kdc build
This will render the image which is based on plain ubuntu 14.04. Additionally the packages heimdal-kdc as well as libsasl2-modules-gssapi-heimdal are installed. The latter is useful only if you extend this container image by further applications making use of Kerberos authentication via SASL2's GSSAPI.

Run the container
./kdc start
On OSX, this step starts by setting up the VM (via boot2docker). Then, on all host systems, the container is started in detached mode, allowing you to keep on working with this shell without having to fork another process. The container name is directly derived from the hostname supplied via the configuration (see Configuration).

Watch the KDC server log file
docker exec -it kdc tail -f /var/log/heimdal-kdc.log
Run a quick test
./kdc test
On OSX, this first checks if the VM is active. Then, on all hosts systems, a network connection to the KDC is attempted.

Prepare the environment
$(./kdc shellinit)
A Kerberos client needs access to a configuration file. To prevent having to edit the system wide configuration file (/etc/krb5.conf) a local, minimal version is rendered and supplied once the container has gotten started. Additionally, the keytab also gets exported and hence needs to be accessible for clients making use of password-less authentication. To make use of the files, environment variables that are interpreted by Kerberos clients are prepared.

Render a ticket supplying the principal password
kinit tillt/hostname.example.com@EXAMPLE.COM
Password: matilda

Check the ticket
klist
On OSX you could also use the Ticket Viewer to check the details of the issued ticket (open "/System/Library/CoreServices/Ticket Viewer.app").

Example output: klist

Credentials cache: API:42926CE1-63E2-4C66-B2D7-00B2F198182F
        Principal: tillt/hostname.example.com@EXAMPLE.COM

  Issued                Expires               Principal
Nov 26 11:06:25 2014  Nov 26 21:06:25 2014  krbtgt/EXAMPLE.COM@EXAMPLE.COM
Remove the ticket
kdestroy
Check the content of the keytab
ktutil --keytab=krb5.keytab list
Example output: ktutil --keytab=krb5.keytab list

krb5.keytab:

Vno  Type                     Principal                              Aliases
  1  aes256-cts-hmac-sha1-96  tillt/hostname.example.com@EXAMPLE.COM
  1  des3-cbc-sha1            tillt/hostname.example.com@EXAMPLE.COM
  1  arcfour-hmac-md5         tillt/hostname.example.com@EXAMPLE.COM
Render a ticket using keytab based authentication
kinit -kt krb5.keytab tillt/hostname.example.com@EXAMPLE.COM
Check the ticket
klist
[...]

Stop the container
./kdc stop
This will stop the KDC server, stop and remove the container and additionally remove the temporary keytab and configuration files.

Customize your configuration
You may use environment variables and/or a JSON configuration file for customizing the setup. The default filename for the JSON file is kdc.json but may be configured by the environment variable KDC_CONFIG.

The default configuration is most likely good enough for your first experiments.

Kerberos principal
env. variable	config node	default
KDC_PRINCIPAL	id	tillt
Note: using a configuration file allows setting up multiple principals (via principals[ ].id).

Kerberos password
env. variable	config node	default
KDC_PASSWORD	password	matilda
Note: using a configuration file allows setting up multiple passwords (via principals[ ].password).

Kerberos client
env. variable	config node	default
KDC_CLIENT	n/a	oufput of hostname -s
Note: when no principals are defined via configuration file, KDC_CLIENT is used to create a full service principal (schema: KDC_PRINCIPAL / KDC_CLIENT . KDC_DOMAIN_NAME @ KDC_REALM_NAME ).

KDC hostname
env. variable	config node	default
KDC_HOST_NAME	n/a	kdc
External KDC IP
env. variable	config node	default
KDC_NATHOST	nat	127.0.0.1
Note: this value gets overridden by the kdc script on OSX to allow for connecting to the boot2docker VM. You shouldn't really need to override this in any case.

External KDC port
env. variable	config node	default
KDC_PORT	port	48088
Kerberos domain name
env. variable	config node	default
KDC_DOMAIN_NAME	domain	hostname cut off output of hostname -f
Kerberos realm name
env. variable	config node	default
KDC_REALM_NAME	realm	capitalized value of KDC_DOMAIN_NAME
Note: it is common practice to simply use the domain-name but all capitalized for this.

Configuration filename
env. variable	config node	default
KDC_CONFIG	n/a	kdc.json
templates/kdc.json

Reference
./kdc start|stop|build|clean|config|shellinit
build
Builds the docker image.

start
Starts the container in detached mode while also producing a Kerberos configuration file (krb5.conf) as well as a Kerberos keytab (krb5.keytab) locally.

Note that the keytab is only readable/usable by the current user unless you change its access rights which is not recommended for production environments.

stop
Stops the container and deletes krb5.conf as well as krb5.keytab.

clean
Removes the docker image.

config
Shows relevant configuration information.

test
Checks if the KDC is reachable and accepting connections.

shellinit
Renders the environment variables needed for using the KDC. KRB5_CONFIG points towards the temporary configuration file. KRB5_KTNAME points towards the temporary keytab file.

TODO
strip down base image to squeeze out some space
refactor code into something less convoluted
allow for an admin server, not just the KDC
Credits
This script was inspired by some work of a co-worker of mine, Matthias Veit. Matthias did the hard work of finding out how to properly route docker ports on boot2docker hosts.
